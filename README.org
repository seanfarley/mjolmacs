#+title: mjolmacs

* Introduction

An experimental project to use the Accessbility API from MacOS via an [[file:20210202172633-emacs.org][emacs]]
dynamic module. Basically, Hammerspoon (or a minimum version of it) for Emacs
lisp. Hence, the name: Mjolnir + Emacs.

This project is currently just a proof of concept. Not even alpha quality.

* Feedback

Any (constructive!) feedback would be welcomed! Especially feedback about
Objective-C and macOS integration!
